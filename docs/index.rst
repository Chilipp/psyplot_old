Interactive data visualization with python
==========================================

Welcome! **psyplot** is a open source python project that mainly combines the
plotting utilities of matplotlib_ and the data management of the xarray_
package. The main purpose is to have a framework that allows a  fast,
attractive, flexible, easily applicable, easily reproducible and especially
an interactive visualization of your data.

The ultimate goal is to help scientiests and especially climate model
developers in their daily work by providing a flexibel visualization tool that
can be enhanced by their own visualization scripts.

The package is very new and there are many features that will be included in
the future. So we are very pleased for feedback! Please simply raise an issue
on `GitHub <https://github.com/Chilipp/psyplot>`__.
