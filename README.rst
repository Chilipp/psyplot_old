Welcome! **psyplot** is an open source python project that mainly combines the
plotting utilities of matplotlib_ and the data management of the xarray_
package. The main purpose is to have a framework that allows a  fast,
attractive, flexible, easily applicable, easily reproducible and especially
an interactive visualization of your data.

The ultimate goal is to help scientiests and especially climate model
developers in their daily work by providing a flexibel visualization tool that
can be enhanced by their own visualization scripts.

The package is very new and there are many features that will be included in
the near future. So we are very pleased for feedback! Please simply raise an issue
on `GitHub <https://github.com/Chilipp/psyplot>`__. The package may also be
enhanced by the psyplot_gui_ module which provides a graphical user interface
for an easier interactive usage.

You can see the full documentation on
`readthedocs.org <http://psyplot.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__.


Acknowledgment
--------------
This package has been developped by Philipp Sommer as a part of the
`PyEarthScience <https://github.com/KMFleischer/PyEarthScience>`__ project.

Thanks to the developers of the matplotlib_, xarray_ and cartopy_
packages for their great packages and for the python delevopers for their
fascinating work on this beautiful language.

A special thanks to Stefan Hagemann and Tobias Stacke from the
Max-Planck-Institute of Meterology in Hamburg, Germany for the motivation on
this project.
