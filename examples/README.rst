Example Gallery
===============
The example gallery provides you with some examples on the general usage
of the psyplot framework and shows you some applications of the different
plotter classes in the psyplot package. You can either download the examples
as a Jupyter Notebook or as a converted python script.

After downloading the jupyter-notebook, you can open it by typing::

    $ jupyter notebook

into the terminal and navigate to the file you downloaded.

Note that the examples are python3 notebooks. If you are using python2, you
might either open the notebook in an editor and rename ``'python3'`` in each of
the files to ``'python3'``, or you create a new conda environment via::

        conda create -n py35 python=3.5
        source activate py35
        conda install notebook ipykernel
        ipython kernel install --user

and install the necessary modules into that environment.
